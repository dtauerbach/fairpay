The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service") apply to your use of www.myfairpay.org, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via myfairpay.org (the "Website"). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, that you can review here.

We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way. Of course, this document is public on FairPay, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version. Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.
